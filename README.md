# Smart.noiz.gr parser

You can use this nodejs project to parse ads from smart.noiz.gr and store them in a local db (json file) and send emails with new content.

All you need to do is copy the `config.js.example` and name it `config.js` and fill a url from smart.noiz.gr in order to parse it. Also you should make a free account on `postmarkapp.com`, which gives you 100 emails per month for free. So you can schedule a cron job to run every 8 hours in order to use the whole capacity of the free emails. You should use the token provided from the email service and put it in the config file.
